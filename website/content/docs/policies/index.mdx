# Policies

The following is a list of policies decided upon by the community and the
OpenBao Technical Steering Committee.

## Community Decisions

 - [Deprecation Policy](/vault/docs/policies/deprecation), for executing the
   deprecation and removal of a feature from the code base.
 - [Plugin Support Policy](/vault/docs/policies/plugins), for deciding which
   plugins to keep within the OpenBao Core distribution and which to support
   as external plugins.

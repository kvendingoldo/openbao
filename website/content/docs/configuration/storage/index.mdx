# `storage` stanza

The `storage` stanza configures the storage backend, which represents the
location for the durable storage of OpenBao's information. Each backend has pros,
cons, advantages, and trade-offs. For example, some backends support high
availability while others provide a more robust backup and restoration process.
For information about a specific backend, choose one from the navigation on the
left.

## Configuration

Storage backend configuration is done through the OpenBao configuration file using
the `storage` stanza:

```hcl
storage [NAME] {
  [PARAMETERS...]
}
```

For example:

```hcl
storage "file" {
  path = "/mnt/openbao/data"
}
```

For configuration options which also read an environment variable, the
environment variable will take precedence over values in the configuration
file.

## Integrated storage vs. external storage

It is recommended to use OpenBao's [integrated
storage](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/raft) for most use cases rather than
configuring another system to store OpenBao data externally. (Integrated Storage is
an **embedded OpenBao data storage** available in Vault 1.4 or later.) Prior to Vault 1.4, Consul was the recommended OpenBao storage.

The table below compares the characteristics of Integrated Storage and External
Storage. Suppose you decide that the additional operational complexity of external storage is worth it for your use case. In that case, there are several external storage options to choose from (e.g., [Consul](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/consul), [DynamoDB](/vault/docs/configuration/storage/dynamodb), etc.).

| Operation                      | Operationally simpler with no additional software installation required.                                                                                                                                                     | Must install and configure the external storage environment outside of OpenBao. For high availability, the external storage should be clustered.                                                                                        |
| Networking                     | One less network hop.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Extra network hop between OpenBao and the external storage system (e.g., Consul cluster).                                                                                                                                               |
| Troubleshooting and monitoring | Integrated Storage is a part of OpenBao; therefore, OpenBao is the only system you need to monitor and troubleshoot.                                                                                                             | The source of failure could be the external storage; therefore, you need to check the health of both OpenBao and the external storage. This requires expertise in the chosen storage backend and additional monitoring of that storage. |
| Data location                  | The encrypted OpenBao data is stored on the same host where the OpenBao server process runs.                                                                                                                                     | The encrypted OpenBao data is stored where the external storage is located. Therefore, the OpenBao server and the data storage are hosted on physically separate hosts.                                                                   |
| System requirements            | Avoid "burstable" CPU and storage options.

### Integrated storage vs. consul as OpenBao storage

[HashiCorp Consul](/consul/docs/intro) is a comprehensive
multi-cloud service networking solution including service mesh, service
discovery, and network infrastructure automation. OpenBao can leverage
Consul's [KV Store](/consul/api-docs/kv) to persist OpenBao data.

The table below highlights the differences between Integrated Storage and
Consul.

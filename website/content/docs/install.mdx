# Installing OpenBao

There are several options to install OpenBao:

1. Install from a [Package Manager](#package-manager).

1. Use a [precompiled binary](#precompiled-binaries).

1. Install [from source](#compiling-from-source).

1. [Helm for Kubernetes](/vault/docs/platform/k8s/helm)


## Package manager

OpenBao manages packages for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, RHEL, Amazon
Linux, and other distributions. Follow the instructions at [OpenBao
Tutorials][learn-vault-install] to add our PGP key, add a repository, and
install.

## Precompiled binaries

To install the precompiled binary, [download](/vault/downloads) the applicable
package for your system. OpenBao is packaged as a zip file.

Once the zip is downloaded, unzip the file into your designated directory. The `bao` binary
inside is all that is necessary to run OpenBao (or `bao.exe` for Windows). No
additional files are required to run OpenBao.

Copy the binary to your system. If you intend to access it from the
command-line, ensure that you place the binary somewhere on your `PATH`.

Refer to the [OpenBao Tutorials][learn-vault-dev-server] to start a server, `put`
your first secret, and use other features of OpenBao.

## Compiling from source

To compile from source, you will need [Go](https://golang.org) installed and
properly configured (including a `GOPATH` environment variable set), as well as
a copy of [`git`](https://www.git-scm.com/) in your `PATH`.

Clone the OpenBao repository from GitHub into your `GOPATH`:

```shell-session
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openbao && cd $_
$ git clone https://github.com/openbao/openbao.git
$ cd openbao
```

Bootstrap the project. This will download and compile libraries and tools needed
to compile OpenBao:

```shell-session
$ make bootstrap
```

Build OpenBao for your current system and put the binary in `./bin/` (relative to
the git checkout). The `make dev` target is just a shortcut that builds `bao`
for only your local build environment (no cross-compiled targets).

```shell-session
$ make dev
```

## Verifying the installation

To verify OpenBao is installed, run `bao -h` on your system. You should
see the help output. If you are executing it from the command line, ensure it is
on your `PATH` to avoid receiving an error that OpenBao is not found.

```shell-session
$ bao -h
```
